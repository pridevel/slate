# Ruby
 
## Introduction 

*Ruby is a powerful, flexible programming language you can use in web/Internet development, to process text, to create games, and as part of the popular Ruby on Rails web framework. Ruby is:

*High-level, meaning reading and writing Ruby is really easyâ€”it looks a lot like regular English!

*Interpreted, meaning you don't need a compiler to write and run Ruby. You can write it on your own computer.

*Object-oriented, meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs. All you need to know is everything in Ruby is an object.

*Easy to use. Ruby was designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often just called "Matz") in 1995. Matz set out to design a language that emphasized human needs over those of the computer, which is why Ruby is so easy to pick up.


## Ruby's Basic DataTypes

* String 
 Strings are the words or phrases. You can define them in single quoutes(' ') or double quotes (" ").
 ```ruby
   my_string = "Hello, World!"
 
   my_other_string = 'What's going on?'
 ```
 
* Number
 Ruby can handle both integers and floating point numbers (numbers with decimals).

```ruby
ten = 10
fifteen_point_two = 15.2
 
twenty_five_point_two = ten + fifteen_point_two;   
//output: 25.2

```

* Booleans
 The value of the boolean can be either true or false.
 ```ruby
 my_boolean = true
 ```

## Variable
* Variables are the letters or words that stores the single value. 

 ```ruby
  x = 20
 ```

## Maths
* You can perform mathematical operation like Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Division (/), Exponentiation (**),
Modulo (%),Multiplication (*) in Ruby.
* For example, 2**3 is 8, since 2**3 means "give me 2 * 2 * 2" (2 multiplied together 3 times). 3**2 is 9 (3 * 3), and so on.

Modulo returns the remainder of division. For example, 25 % 7 would be 4, since 7 goes into 25 3 times with 4 left over.
